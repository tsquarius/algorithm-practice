Q: Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.

A: We would need to come up with a way to split up the array into 3 equal parts.
However, whenever we insert or remove an item into one stack, we have to be 
mindful of the other 2 stacks. This may lead us to maintain "null" values within the
array.
